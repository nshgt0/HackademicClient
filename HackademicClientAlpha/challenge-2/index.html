				<p><strong>Did you know:</strong>The original ‘Hamburg Steak’ (a mix of shredded low-grade beef and local seasoning) is from the North German city, supposedly first sold and eaten in the 18th century.
				Similar to the way pizza travelled from Italy to the United States in the early 20th century, the Hamburg Steak recipe ended up stateside in the late 1800s.</p>
