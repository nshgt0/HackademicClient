			<p>Mission ID: 01</p>
			<p>Mission Summary:</p>
			<p>One of our top agents is working on a critical mission for our organization. Due the nature of his mission he is expected to send his reports to us in an rather unconvetional way.</p>
			<p>He will be taking control of small low-profile websites and upload his reports on their server. We need someone to retrieve those reports for us, that someone is you.</p>
			<p>His first report should be ready by now. Your mission is to retrieve that report from our "rendezvous" website.</p>	
			<p>Good luck agent, type <strong>start</strong> to be redirected to the website.</p>				
			<p>Mission Requirements: Basic HTML</p>
